## **Introduction**

Learning a new technology or skill can be overwhelming, but with the right roadmap, you can navigate your way to mastery. This repository contains detailed roadmaps to guide you step by step through various topics, such as programming languages, data science, web development, and more.

Each roadmap provides:
- A structured plan with daily or weekly learning tasks.
- Hands-on exercises to practice what you’ve learned.
- Capstone projects to apply your knowledge.
- Resources and tools for further exploration.
